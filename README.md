Remote Temperature &amp; Humidity Monitoring with ESP32 and DHT22  This project uses an ESP32 and a DHT22 sensor to read temperature and humidity data. The ESP32 connects to your Wi-Fi network (within your routerâ€™s range) and sends the sensor data, which you can view from anywhere. Developed using PlatformIO for ease of development and deployment.
